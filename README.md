# Some QR Code Reader

Trying to make a QR Code reader just by using principles learned in SVML
using `numpy` and `opencv2`


This is just an educational repo, nothing you should use anywhere.

## Files:

```
   ★ main.py   -- main file, including all of the actual code
   ★ README.md -- you are here
   ★ unutil.py -- algorithms I implemented for ed. purposes, but aren't optimized enough to be used
```
